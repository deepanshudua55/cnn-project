# 3D Convolutional Neural Networks with Optical Flow Regularization for Video Recognition
...is the long title. The short one would be Special Regularization for 3D ConvNets.

## Proposed idea
Infuse the 3D CNN model with the assumptions used in optical flow computaitons in a *soft* way through a special regularization on the filters.

## In this project
We test the merit of this idea by training ConvNets from scratch on the UCF101 Human Action Recognition data set using Theano.
